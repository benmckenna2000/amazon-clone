## Demo account

### Email: 123@outlook.com

### Password: 123123

This account has been made with the purpose of testing the website, nobody wants to waste their time creating an account!
With this login you will be able to access all features of the site.

## Demo payment details

### Card Number: 4242424242424242 
### MM/YY: 0424 
### CVC: 242 
### ZIP: 424242

This application uses stripe to handle payments, when I set it up I used the test key, which allows us to be
able to use mock card details to test whether or not the functionality behind payments works, this site is also just for show and not a
real use case, so therefore there's no need to implement the real version of Stripe.
